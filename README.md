5E-Spell-Searcher
=================

A little PHP website app thing that can organzie/find spells of the Fifth Edition variety.  Does not include the spells, partially for legal reasons,
but mostly because they aren't all transcribed yet.
Runs in a WinAMP style setup, doubtlessly runs in vanilla LAMP servers too.  Has been tested primarily with PHP 5.6.3.
