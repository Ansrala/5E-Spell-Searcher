5E-Spell-Searcher
=================

A little PHP website app thing that can organzie/find spells of the Fifth Edition variety.  Does not include the spells, partially for legal reasons,
but mostly because they aren't all transcribed yet.
Runs in a WinAMP style setup, doubtlessly runs in vanilla LAMP servers too.  Has been tested primarily with PHP 5.6.3.

Work not by me but by [Joe Moore](https://github.com/Ansrala)

##Setup
You will need to make sure the connection details are correct in connect_database.php before you get your server all up.

You will need to manually create the Database and user on your database, if you don't want to change values you are free to use the setup script in the dev folder.
Once that is done, just direct a browser to create_database.php.
